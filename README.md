# Weather App

This is a weather app created using vite with a react template and tailwind css

I did this project for learning purposes and is my first project using tailwind, so i do intend to improve gradually.

Here are a few things that i intend to add:

- show a map, or a picture, that represent that area
- instead of a simple picture to represent the weather, do an animation
