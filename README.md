# Weather App

This is a basic weather app created using vite with a react template and tailwind css

I did this project for learning purposes and is my first project using tailwind, so i do intend to improve gradually.

Here are a few things that i intend to add:

- a search bar, that conform i type in automatically shows a few possible answers
- add a daily forecast off the week
- show a map, or a picture, that represent that area (im not to sure about this one)
